--- Ver 1.0.6.0 --- 
Fixed Targeting system for Me vs Mob
added a TON of logging.
Added preclude functionality so we dont go through the logic and targeting when we arent going to use it.
Added time delay in spells being cast so we dont spam the same spell with low GCD over and over (this will be configureable eventually)
Added auto compilating of routine name by adding spec and class to it.
Updated routine list on creation of a new one so you can swithc back and forth without reloading the gui.
Extended orm to allow enum serialization
Added Use tanks target option
Removed text based operator drop down and converted to a bound enum.
Fixed bug that would cause the enum values not to serialize properly when choosing "edit"
