Eclipse - ShadowBot

ToDo List:
	Add hearth command
	If leader is dead, follow secondary target in group - needs to be tested
	If someone in party is dead and we are not in combat, rez them
	Should disconnect from leader on stop of honorbuddy.
	Mounting doesnt work anymore.
	Closing the leader, crashes all followers
	When following a leader - pick a point to teh side of them rather than always stacking on the exact point.
	If the leader is lost (out of memory)- query for its position with the connection.

	Add the rest of the armor classes - for choosing quest rewards.
	Fixed -- Bot prioritizing combat over following leader.
	Sometimes it errors getting current location.
	Fixed -- Tries to move before a mount is fully summoned.
	Fixed -- When quest is outside follow distance it yo-yos





	 Testing Notes:
[12:39:52 AM] Hari: The shadowbot does not accept LFG Signup
Done --- [12:39:52 AM] Hari: also, it doesnt follow mount up assigned in Settings & Tools, it uses the first mount on the list.
[12:41:19 AM] Hari: It also doesnt use Flight paths as the leader used.
Done ---- [12:46:25 AM] Hari: when i changed between zones like Elwyn Forest and Duskwood then the bots stopped due to "Phased zone change" The problem is that i did not see my other 2 chars for 1 sec but then they popped back and the bots just stands there untill i manually "Start Following" again
[12:47:17 AM] Hari: when encountering combat on the leader the followers does not dismount to help. they just stand there mounted.
[12:50:47 AM] Hari: the followers are always trying to pick up a new quest if available but that is a HUGE problem if the leader isnt picking up any quests and wants to ignore them. it should be so if leader picked up or targets the quest giver THEN the followers should go pick up that quest.
[12:52:28 AM] Hari: The Followers does not learn New Flight Points if available when standing Next to the NPC
Done -- [12:54:57 AM] Hari: there should also be a "Dismount" call in the command section
[1:48:03 PM] Hari: when healbot with assist leader then it will stay mounted you need to make it auto dismount when leader dismounts
Done ---- [1:48:17 PM] Hari: also it tries to mount ALOT when leader mounts
Done ---- [1:48:24 PM] Hari: keeps mounting up and spams the bot log
