-- Ver 2.05 --
Fixed wait to use more realistic wait times after skinning or looting.
Added new screen that allows you to manually add skinnable mobs. 
added functionality to ban a mob that IS skinnable (such as flying mobs because HB is not so good at handling them)
Fixed bug where bot would sometimes go into non skinnable functions and thereby not keep skinning mobs.
